**Author:** Namyun Kim  
**Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the AI governance framework that enables the platform to achieve **95% accuracy** while maintaining **complete audit trails** and **regulatory compliance**. The key innovation: a four-layer validation framework that compensates for AI limitations through architectural design rather than relying solely on model capabilities.

**Core Principle:** AI assists humans; humans validate AI. No decision executes without human review or explicit confidence thresholds.

## 1. Governance Principles

### Design Philosophy

Every AI decision must be:
1. **Explainable** - Users understand WHY the AI made each decision
2. **Reversible** - Humans can override any AI output
3. **Auditable** - Every decision has a complete trail (who, when, why, confidence)
4. **Bounded** - AI operates within clearly defined constraints

### Responsible AI Commitments

| Principle | Implementation | Validation |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Transparency** | Confidence scores for every extraction | Users see AI certainty before accepting |
| **Accountability** | Human-in-the-loop for <90% confidence | No auto-execution of uncertain decisions |
| **Fairness** | Schema-based validation (no bias) | Type/range checks apply uniformly |
| **Privacy** | Local processing (no cloud APIs) | Documents never leave client infrastructure |

---

## 2. Validation Framework

### Four-Layer Architecture

The platform doesn't rely on raw AI accuracy. Instead, it uses **layered validation** to improve from 85% → 95% accuracy:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 1: Type Validation        (+5% accuracy)     │
│ ├─ Ensures data types match schema                 │
│ └─ Rejects "eight" in numeric field                │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 2: Range Validation       (+3% accuracy)     │
│ ├─ Flags impossible values                         │
│ └─ Catches "28 hours/day" or "200% completion"     │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 3: Logic Validation       (+2% accuracy)     │
│ ├─ Detects contradictions                          │
│ └─ Flags status="done" + compliance="failed"       │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 4: Human Review           (Final quality)    │
│ ├─ Escalates <90% confidence                       │
│ └─ Expert validates edge cases                     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Result: 85% raw AI → 95% validated output
```

### 2.1 Type Validation (Layer 1)

**Purpose:** Ensure extracted data matches expected data types

**Implementation Approach:**
Use schema validation framework (e.g., Pydantic) to define expected data types for each field. The framework automatically rejects data that doesn't match the schema.

**Example Schema Rules:**
- Invoice number: Must be a string (not empty)
- Invoice date: Must be a valid date format
- Amount: Must be a non-negative number
- Line items: Must be a positive integer

**What it catches:**
- ❌ "eight" in numeric field → Rejected
- ❌ "2023-13-45" as date → Rejected
- ❌ Empty invoice number → Rejected
- ✅ Valid types → Passed to Layer 2

**Impact:** +5% accuracy (90% total)

---

### 2.2 Range Validation (Layer 2)

**Purpose:** Flag values that are technically valid but practically impossible

**Implementation Approach:**
Define business-logic constraints for each field. The validation framework checks whether values fall within acceptable ranges based on real-world limits.

**Example Range Rules:**
- Hours worked: Must be 0-24 (can't work more than 24 hours/day)
- Days worked: Must be 0-31 (can't work more than 31 days/month)
- Completion rate: Must be 0-100% (percentage range)

**What it catches:**
- ❌ 28 hours worked in one day → Flagged for review
- ❌ 150% completion rate → Flagged
- ❌ Negative payment amount → Flagged
- ✅ Reasonable values → Passed to Layer 3

**Impact:** +3% accuracy (93% total)

---

### 2.3 Logic Validation (Layer 3)

**Purpose:** Detect contradictions across multiple fields

**Implementation Approach:**
Define cross-field validation rules that check logical consistency. The framework validates that combinations of field values make sense together.

**Example Logical Rules:**
- If status = "completed", compliance_check cannot = "failed"
- If payment_issued = true, status cannot = "failed"
- start_date must be before end_date
- If project is "on hold", hours_worked should be zero

**What it catches:**
- ❌ status="completed" + compliance="failed" → Flagged
- ❌ payment_issued=True + status="failed" → Flagged
- ❌ start_date > end_date → Flagged
- ✅ Logically consistent → Passed to Layer 4

**Impact:** +2% accuracy (95% total)

---

### 2.4 Human Review (Layer 4)

**Purpose:** Expert validation for low-confidence or edge cases

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Confidence score <90%
- Validation failures (any of Layers 1-3)
- Unusual document formats
- First-time document types

**Human Review Interface:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ REVIEW REQUIRED: Low Confidence (78%)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Field: Invoice Amount                       │
│ AI Extracted: €1,234.56                     │
│ Confidence: 78%                             │
│                                             │
│ Source: [Show PDF highlight]                │
│                                             │
│ Actions:                                    │
│  ✓ Approve    ✗ Reject    ✎ Edit          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Impact:** Ensures 95% accuracy while maintaining user trust

## 3. Human Oversight Model

### 3.1 Decision Authority Matrix

| AI Confidence | Action | Human Involvement |
|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| **95-100%** | Auto-flag for review | Human approves batch (quality check) |
| **90-94%** | Suggest with warning | Human reviews individual item |
| **<90%** | Require human input | Human validates before acceptance |
| **Validation failure** | Block processing | Human resolves issue |

**Key Principle:** AI never makes final decisions. Humans always in control.

---

### 3.2 Confidence Score Transparency

**Every extraction shows:**
- Overall document confidence (e.g., 92%)
- Per-field confidence (e.g., Amount: 87%, Date: 98%)
- Reasoning (e.g., "Low confidence due to handwritten text")

**Example UI:**
```
Invoice #12345 - Overall Confidence: 92%
├─ Invoice Number: 98% ✓ (High)
├─ Date: 95% ✓ (High)
├─ Amount: 87% ⚠ (Medium - Review Recommended)
└─ Vendor: 99% ✓ (High)

Recommendation: Review "Amount" field before approval
```

**User empowerment:** Users decide their own confidence thresholds (default 90%)

## 4. Audit & Traceability

### 4.1 Complete Decision Trail

**Every AI decision logs:**
1. **Input:** Original document (PDF stored securely)
2. **Extraction:** AI raw output + confidence scores
3. **Validation:** Which layers passed/failed
4. **Human Action:** Approved/rejected/edited + timestamp + user ID
5. **Final Output:** What was actually recorded

**Example Audit Entry:**
```json
{
  "document_id": "INV-2024-001",
  "timestamp": "2024-11-15T14:23:45Z",
  "user_id": "CA-007",
  "ai_extraction": {
    "invoice_number": "12345",
    "amount": 1234.56,
    "confidence": 87
  },
  "validation": {
    "type_check": "PASS",
    "range_check": "PASS",
    "logic_check": "PASS"
  },
  "human_decision": "EDITED",
  "correction": {
    "field": "amount",
    "original": 1234.56,
    "corrected": 1243.56,
    "reason": "OCR misread '3' as '4'"
  },
  "final_output": {
    "invoice_number": "12345",
    "amount": 1243.56,
    "status": "PROCESSED"
  }
}
```

**Retention:** 7 years (regulatory requirement)

---

### 4.2 Audit Query Capabilities

**Stakeholders can answer:**
- Who approved this document?
- What was the AI's original suggestion?
- Were there any corrections? What and why?
- How confident was the AI?
- Which documents required human review?

**Example Query Capabilities:**
- Find all documents where AI confidence was below threshold
- Find all human corrections in a given time period
- Track which validation layers most frequently flag issues
- Analyze patterns in AI errors to improve the system

**Compliance Benefit:** Auditors can trace every decision back to source.

---

### 4.3 Explainability Reports

**Designed reporting capabilities for production:**

**Monthly Governance Summary:**
- Total documents processed
- AI accuracy (pre-validation vs post-validation)
- Documents requiring human review (count and percentage)
- Common issues by category (e.g., handwritten text, scanned quality, unusual layouts)
- Average processing time vs manual baseline
- Cost savings realized

**Actionable Insights:**
The reporting system would identify patterns in AI performance, enabling continuous improvement. For example, if handwritten amounts consistently trigger human review, this signals an area for targeted model improvement or additional validation rules.

**Value for Stakeholders:**
- Product teams: Prioritize improvements based on data
- Compliance officers: Demonstrate governance effectiveness
- Business sponsors: Track ROI and cost savings
- Users: See system improvement over time

## 6. Risk Mitigation

### 6.1 Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|--------|
| **AI hallucination** (wrong extraction) | Medium | High | 4-layer validation + human review | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Data breach** | Low | Critical | Local processing + encryption | ✅ Mitigated |
| **System downtime** | Low | Medium | SQLite → PostgreSQL failover (planned) | ⚠️ Planned |
| **User over-reliance on AI** | Medium | Medium | Confidence scores + mandatory review | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Regulatory non-compliance** | Low | Critical | Audit trails + data sovereignty | ✅ Mitigated |

---

### 6.2 Failure Modes & Safeguards

#### Failure Mode 1: AI Extraction Fails
**Safeguard:** PyMuPDF fallback → Manual review if both fail
**User Impact:** Minimal (manual entry, same as before automation)

#### Failure Mode 2: Validation Rejects Valid Data
**Safeguard:** Human override capability
**User Impact:** Brief delay for review (still faster than full manual)

#### Failure Mode 3: System Crash Mid-Processing
**Safeguard:** Transaction rollback, document reprocessing
**User Impact:** Restart document (no data loss)

#### Failure Mode 4: User Approves Incorrect AI Output
**Safeguard:** Audit trail enables post-hoc correction
**User Impact:** Correctable via edit + re-approval

**Key Principle:** No irreversible decisions. Every action can be traced and corrected.
